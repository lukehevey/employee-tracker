  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to create an employee tracker command-line application to manage a company's employee database. Node.js, Inquirer, and MYSQl were used in this application. Linking tables together in the database came with difficulty. I will continue to get better with databases.
  
  
  ## Installation
  Install inquirer and MYSQl.
  
  
  ## Usage
  Navigate to the command-line and type npm start.
